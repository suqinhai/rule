# 159 Send Rss Feed Data To Webhook

This workflow periodically checks an RSS feed, filters the articles based on specific keywords, and stores the unique articles in a MongoDB database, while also sending notifications about the new articles.

Example: A real estate company could use this workflow to automatically monitor industry news and blogs, identify relevant articles about the real estate market or specific properties, and store them in a database for further analysis or sharing with their team.

## What You Can Do
- Scheduled RSS feed monitoring with the ability to manually trigger the workflow
- Filtering articles based on keywords like "realtors" or "real estate"
- Deduplicating articles based on the link URL and storing them in a MongoDB database
- Sending notifications about new articles via a webhook

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
