# 2419 Visual Regression Testing With Apify And Ai Vision Model

This workflow automates a visual regression testing process for websites, using AI-powered image comparison to detect and report changes.

Example: A marketing team responsible for maintaining a company's website could use this workflow to regularly check for unintended changes to their webpages. The workflow generates baseline screenshots, compares them to new screenshots, and creates a report in a project management tool like Linear to track and address any visual regressions.

## What You Can Do
- Automated screenshot generation and storage in Google Drive
- AI-powered visual regression testing using Google's Gemini model
- Structured output parsing and reporting of detected changes
- Scheduled execution and integration with project management tools

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
