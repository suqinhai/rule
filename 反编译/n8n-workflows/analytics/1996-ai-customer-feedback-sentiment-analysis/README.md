# 1996 Ai Customer Feedback Sentiment Analysis

This workflow automates the process of collecting customer feedback, analyzing the sentiment using OpenAI, and then storing the feedback along with the sentiment analysis in a Google Sheets spreadsheet.

Example: A company that wants to gather customer feedback and analyze the sentiment can use this workflow. Customers can submit feedback through a form, which triggers the workflow to send the feedback to OpenAI for sentiment analysis. The analyzed feedback is then merged with the original form data and added to a Google Sheets spreadsheet for further review and analysis.

## What You Can Do
- Automated customer feedback collection and sentiment analysis using OpenAI
- Integration with Google Sheets to store and organize the feedback data
- Customizable form fields and options to capture relevant information

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

⚠️ WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. 🚫

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
