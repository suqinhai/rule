# 2451 Download And Compress Folder From S3 To Zip File

This workflow downloads all files from a specific folder in an AWS S3 bucket, compresses them into a ZIP file, and makes the compressed file available for download.

Example: A marketing team needs to share a large number of files with a client, but the files are stored in an S3 bucket. This workflow allows them to easily download all the files in a compressed format, which can then be shared with the client.

## What You Can Do
- Automatically downloads all files from a specified folder in an S3 bucket
- Compresses the downloaded files into a single ZIP file
- Provides the compressed file for easy download or further processing

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
