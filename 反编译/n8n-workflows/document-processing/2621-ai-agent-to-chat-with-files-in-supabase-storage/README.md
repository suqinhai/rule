# 2621 Ai Agent To Chat With Files In Supabase Storage

This workflow automates the process of fetching, processing, and storing text and PDF files from a Supabase storage, enabling an AI-powered chatbot to query and retrieve context-based information from the uploaded files.

Example: A company that manages a large repository of technical documents, reports, and research papers could use this workflow to streamline the process of making this information easily accessible to their employees. The workflow would automatically fetch new files from the Supabase storage, extract and vectorize the content, and store it in a vector store. Employees could then interact with the AI chatbot to quickly find relevant information from the document repository, without having to manually search through the files.

## What You Can Do
- Automated file processing and storage: The workflow fetches new files from Supabase storage, extracts the content, and stores the vectorized data in a Supabase vector store.
- AI-powered chatbot integration: The workflow includes an AI chatbot that can be used to query the stored document data and retrieve relevant information.
- Efficient data retrieval: The use of vector embeddings and a vector store allows for fast and contextual information retrieval, making it easy to find relevant content within the document repository.

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
