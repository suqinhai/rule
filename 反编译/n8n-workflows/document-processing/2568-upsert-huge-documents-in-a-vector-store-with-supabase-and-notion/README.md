# 2568 Upsert Huge Documents In A Vector Store With Supabase And Notion

This workflow automatically ingests and embeds content from a Notion knowledge base, stores the embeddings in a Supabase vector store, and provides a conversational interface to query the knowledge base using natural language.

Example: A company maintains a Notion-based knowledge base for their internal teams. This workflow automatically processes new and updated content in the knowledge base, creating vector embeddings and storing them in a Supabase database. Employees can then interact with a chatbot interface to ask questions and receive relevant information from the knowledge base.

## What You Can Do
- Automatic ingestion and embedding of Notion content
- Storage of embeddings in a scalable vector store (Supabase)
- Conversational interface for querying the knowledge base using natural language

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
