# 663 Download A File And Upload It To An Ftp Server

This workflow automates the process of downloading an image from a URL, uploading it to an FTP server, and then listing the contents of the upload directory on the FTP server.

Example: A user might use this workflow to regularly upload a company logo or other important image to an FTP server for easy access and distribution. The workflow can be triggered manually, allowing the user to upload the image on-demand.

## What You Can Do
- Automatic download of an image from a specified URL
- Seamless upload of the downloaded image to an FTP server
- Listing of the contents of the FTP server's upload directory for verification

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
