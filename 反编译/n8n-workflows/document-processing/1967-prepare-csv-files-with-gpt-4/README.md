# 1967 Prepare Csv Files With Gpt 4

This workflow generates a list of 10 random user profiles with fictional character names, saves them as CSV files, and stores them on the local disk.

Example: A marketing team might use this workflow to create a set of sample user profiles for testing or demonstration purposes, without having to manually create the data. The workflow can be easily customized to generate different types of data or save the files to a cloud storage service instead of the local disk.

## What You Can Do
- Generates a list of 10 random user profiles using the OpenAI API
- Splits the data into individual CSV files and saves them to the local disk
- Includes a feature to strip UTF-8 BOM bytes from the CSV files, ensuring compatibility with various data processing tools

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
