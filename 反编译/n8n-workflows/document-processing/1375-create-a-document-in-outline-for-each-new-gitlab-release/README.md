# 1375 Create A Document In Outline For Each New Gitlab Release

This workflow automatically creates a new document in Outline (a knowledge base tool) whenever a new release is pushed to a GitLab repository.

Example: A software development team uses this workflow to automatically document their software releases. Whenever a new release is pushed to their GitLab repository, the workflow triggers and creates a new document in Outline with the release details, including the release name, description, and a link to the release.

## What You Can Do
- Automatically triggered by GitLab release events
- Extracts relevant release information from the GitLab event payload
- Creates a new document in Outline with the release details
- Supports customizing the document content and structure

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?

* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
