# 586 Read A Spreadsheet File

This workflow allows users to manually trigger the extraction and processing of data from a spreadsheet file.

Example: A business analyst could use this workflow to quickly and easily access and analyze data from a spreadsheet file, without having to manually open and manipulate the file.

## What You Can Do
- Manual trigger: Users can initiate the workflow by clicking the "execute" button, making it easy to run on-demand.
- Spreadsheet file processing: The workflow can read and process data from a spreadsheet file, enabling users to extract and work with the data.
- Binary file reading: The workflow can read binary files, such as CSV files, allowing users to work with a variety of data formats.

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

⚠️ WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. 🚫

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
