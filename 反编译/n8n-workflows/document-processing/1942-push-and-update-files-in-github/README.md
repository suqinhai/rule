# 1942 Push And Update Files In Github

This workflow automates the process of updating a file in a GitHub repository and adding a new file, then pushing the changes back to the remote repository.

Example: A developer or content creator can use this workflow to quickly update the README file in a GitHub repository and add a new Markdown file, all without leaving the n8n interface. This can be useful for making small updates or additions to a project's documentation.

## What You Can Do
- Retrieves the current contents of the README file from the GitHub repository
- Appends new content to the README file and creates a new Markdown file
- Commits the changes and pushes them back to the remote GitHub repository
- Provides a user-friendly interface for configuring the local repository path

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
