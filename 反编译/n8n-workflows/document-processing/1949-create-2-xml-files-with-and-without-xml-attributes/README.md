# 1949 Create 2 Xml Files With And Without Xml Attributes

This workflow retrieves a set of random products from a MySQL database, formats the product data into XML files, and saves them to the local file system.

Example: A business that sells various products could use this workflow to generate XML files containing details about a set of randomly selected products. These XML files could then be used for further processing, such as integrating with a third-party system or generating reports.

## What You Can Do
- Retrieves a set of random products from a MySQL database
- Formats the product data into two different XML structures (simple and with attributes)
- Saves the generated XML files to the local file system

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:

* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
