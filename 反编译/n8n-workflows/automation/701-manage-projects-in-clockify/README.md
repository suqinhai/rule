# 701 Manage Projects In Clockify

This workflow automates the process of creating and managing Clockify time entries for a specific project and task, providing a streamlined way to track and report on time spent on documentation-related work.

Example: A content writer or documentation specialist could use this workflow to easily log their time spent working on documentation projects, automatically creating a new Clockify time entry with relevant details like project, task, and description. This helps them accurately track their time and generate reports for billing or productivity purposes.

## What You Can Do
- Automatically creates a new Clockify time entry with pre-defined project, task, and description details
- Allows for updating the project associated with a time entry after it has been created
- Provides a centralized way to manage and report on time spent on documentation-related work

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
