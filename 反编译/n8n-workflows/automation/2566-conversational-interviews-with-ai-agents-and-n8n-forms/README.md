# 2566 Conversational Interviews With Ai Agents And N8N Forms

This workflow automates an AI-powered user interview process, recording the questions and answers in a Google Sheet for later analysis.

Example: A researcher can use this workflow to conduct an ongoing interview with users about their experiences preparing for and taking the UK practical driving test. The workflow handles the interview flow, records the transcript, and saves the data to a Google Sheet for further analysis.

## What You Can Do
- AI-powered interview agent that dynamically generates questions based on the user's previous responses
- Scalable session management using Redis to handle multiple concurrent interviews
- Automatic transcript recording and storage in a Google Sheet for easy data analysis
- Customizable completion screen with the full interview transcript

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
