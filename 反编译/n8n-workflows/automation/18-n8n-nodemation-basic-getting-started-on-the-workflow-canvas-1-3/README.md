# 18 N8N Nodemation Basic Getting Started On The Workflow Canvas 1 3

This workflow periodically executes a custom function that sets two variables, and then uses the Set node to extract one of those variables and store it in the workflow's data.

Example: This workflow could be used to periodically generate and store a dynamic value, such as a timestamp or a random number, that can be used in other parts of the workflow or shared with other systems.

## What You Can Do
- Executes a custom function every 2 hours to generate dynamic data
- Stores a specific variable from the function's output in the workflow's data
- Can be easily integrated with other nodes or systems to utilize the generated data

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
