# 437 Perform Speech To Text On Recorded Audio Clips Using Wit Ai

This workflow converts a local audio file into a format suitable for processing by a speech recognition API, allowing users to transcribe audio content.

Example: A marketing team could use this workflow to automatically transcribe audio recordings of customer interviews, enabling them to quickly identify key insights and feedback without manually listening to the full recordings.

## What You Can Do
- Reads a binary audio file from a local file path
- Sends the audio data to a speech recognition API (in this case, Wit.ai) using an HTTP POST request
- Handles the necessary headers and content types to ensure the API can properly process the audio data

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)
