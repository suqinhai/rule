# 1947 Sql To Xml Export With Xsl Template Formatting

This workflow retrieves a set of random products from a MySQL database, formats the data into an XML structure, and serves it as a dynamic web page with an associated XSL stylesheet.

Example: A company that sells various products could use this workflow to quickly generate a web page that displays a selection of their products, with the ability to customize the presentation using an XSL stylesheet. This could be useful for showcasing new products, creating a product catalog, or providing a dynamic product listing on the company's website.

## What You Can Do
- Retrieves a set of random products from a MySQL database
- Formats the product data into an XML structure
- Generates an HTML page with an embedded XSL stylesheet for dynamic presentation
- Serves the XML and XSL content as a response to a webhook request

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
