# 2417 Flux Ai Image Generator

This workflow generates unique, AI-powered images based on user-provided prompts and style preferences, and serves the generated images on a responsive web page.

Example: A user could visit a website that hosts this workflow, enter a prompt like "An astronaut riding a horse in 35mm style" and select a style like "Neon Fauvism", then the workflow would generate a custom image based on those inputs and display it on the webpage.

## What You Can Do
- Allows users to input custom text prompts and select from pre-defined visual styles
- Utilizes the Hugging Face API to generate the images based on the user's inputs
- Automatically uploads the generated images to an S3 storage bucket for hosting
- Serves the generated images on a responsive, mobile-friendly web page with additional context and options

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
