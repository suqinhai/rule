# 602 Manage Users Automatically In Reqres In

This workflow automates a series of HTTP requests to the Reqres.in API, allowing users to retrieve, create, and update user data.

Example: A small business owner could use this workflow to quickly fetch a list of users from the Reqres.in API, create a new user with specific details, and then update the job title for an existing user, all without writing any code.

## What You Can Do
- Triggered by a manual click, allowing users to execute the workflow on-demand
- Performs a GET request to retrieve a list of users from the Reqres.in API
- Sends a POST request to create a new user with a specified name and job
- Sends a PATCH request to update the job title for an existing user

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
