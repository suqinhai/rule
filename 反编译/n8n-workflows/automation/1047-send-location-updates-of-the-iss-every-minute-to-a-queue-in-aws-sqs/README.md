# 1047 Send Location Updates Of The Iss Every Minute To A Queue In Aws Sqs

This workflow retrieves the current location of the International Space Station (ISS) and sends the data to an AWS SQS queue at a regular interval.

Example: A company that tracks the location of the ISS for educational or research purposes could use this workflow to automatically collect and store the latest ISS coordinates in a centralized queue, which could then be accessed and processed by other systems or applications.

## What You Can Do
- Retrieves the current latitude, longitude, and timestamp of the ISS using the "Where The ISS At" API
- Formats the data into a structured format and sends it to an AWS SQS queue
- Runs on a regular schedule (every minute) to provide up-to-date information

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
