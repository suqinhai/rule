# 2223 Set Credentials Dynamically Using Expressions

This workflow allows users to securely authenticate with the NASA API using a dynamic API key entered through a form, and then redirects them to the NASA picture of the day.

Example: A user wants to access the NASA picture of the day, but needs to authenticate with an API key. This workflow provides a simple form where the user can enter their API key, which is then securely passed to the NASA node to fetch the picture of the day. The user is then redirected to the image.

## What You Can Do
- Secure API key management using expressions
- Dynamic form for user input
- Automatic redirection to the NASA picture of the day

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
