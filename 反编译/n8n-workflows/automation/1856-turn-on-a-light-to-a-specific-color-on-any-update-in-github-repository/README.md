# 1856 Turn On A Light To A Specific Color On Any Update In Github Repository

This workflow turns a light in a Home Assistant instance red whenever an update is made to a GitHub repository.

Example: A developer could use this workflow to be notified whenever a change is made to their project's GitHub repository by having a light in their office turn red. This could help them stay aware of activity in their codebase and respond to issues or pull requests more quickly.

## What You Can Do
- Triggers on any update to a specified GitHub repository, including pull requests, issues, and pushes.
- Integrates with Home Assistant to control a smart light, turning it red when an update occurs.
- Allows for customization of the light entity and RGB color to be used.

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
