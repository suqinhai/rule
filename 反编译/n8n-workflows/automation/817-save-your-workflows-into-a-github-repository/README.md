# 817 Save Your Workflows Into A Github Repository

This workflow automatically backs up and synchronizes n8n workflows to a GitHub repository, detecting and handling changes to ensure consistency.

Example: A team using n8n for their workflow automation needs can use this workflow to regularly (e.g., daily) backup their n8n workflows to a GitHub repository. This ensures that their workflows are version-controlled and can be easily shared, restored, or updated across the team.

## What You Can Do
- Automatic daily backup of n8n workflows to a GitHub repository
- Intelligent detection of changes, allowing for seamless updates or creation of new workflow files
- Flexible configuration of the GitHub repository details (owner, name, path) through the "Globals" node

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
