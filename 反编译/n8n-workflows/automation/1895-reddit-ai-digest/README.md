# 1895 Reddit Ai Digest

This workflow automatically scans Reddit for posts related to the n8n workflow automation tool, analyzes the content using OpenAI, and generates a summary and categorization of the posts.

Example: A marketing team at n8n could use this workflow to monitor online discussions about their product, identify relevant posts, and quickly summarize the key points to stay informed about customer sentiment and product usage.

## What You Can Do
- Automatically retrieves the latest Reddit posts containing the keyword "n8n"
- Filters posts based on criteria like upvotes, recency, and content length to focus on the most relevant ones
- Uses OpenAI to classify whether a post is actually about the n8n tool and generate a concise summary
- Stores key metrics like upvotes, subreddit size, and post date for further analysis

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
