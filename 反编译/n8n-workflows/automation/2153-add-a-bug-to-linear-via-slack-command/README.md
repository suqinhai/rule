# 2153 Add A Bug To Linear Via Slack Command

This workflow automates the process of creating a new issue in a project management tool (Linear) based on a bug report submitted through a Slack slash command.

Example: A software development team uses this workflow to streamline their bug reporting process. Whenever a team member encounters a bug, they can simply type `/bug` in their Slack channel, which triggers the workflow to create a new issue in Linear with the bug details. The workflow also sends a message back to the Slack channel, providing the team member with a link to add more information about the bug.

## What You Can Do
- Integrates with Slack to accept bug reports through a custom slash command
- Automatically creates a new issue in Linear with the bug details
- Sends a message back to Slack with a link to add more information about the bug

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:

* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
