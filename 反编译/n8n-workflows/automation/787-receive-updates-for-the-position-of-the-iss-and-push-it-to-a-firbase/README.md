# 787 Receive Updates For The Position Of The Iss And Push It To A Firbase

This workflow periodically retrieves the current location of the International Space Station (ISS) and stores it in a Google Firebase Realtime Database.

Example: A space enthusiast or educator could use this workflow to track the real-time location of the ISS and display it on a dashboard or website, allowing users to follow the satellite's movements.

## What You Can Do
- Scheduled data retrieval using a Cron trigger
- Fetching ISS location data from the Where the ISS At? API
- Storing the latitude, longitude, and timestamp in a Google Firebase Realtime Database

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
