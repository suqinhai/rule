# 1469 Post Rss Feed Items From Yesterday To Slack

This workflow automatically fetches the latest blog posts from the n8n.io RSS feed, filters them to include only those published since yesterday, and then posts a summary of the new posts to a Slack channel.

Example: A marketing team could use this workflow to stay up-to-date on the latest content published by their company's blog, and share the most recent posts with their colleagues in a timely and organized manner.

## What You Can Do
- Scheduled daily execution to ensure the latest blog posts are shared
- Filtering of posts to only include those published since the previous day
- Formatting the post summaries in a clean and visually appealing way for Slack

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?

* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
