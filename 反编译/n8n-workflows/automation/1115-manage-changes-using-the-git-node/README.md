# 1115 Manage Changes Using The Git Node

This workflow automates the process of creating a new Git commit and pushing it to a repository with a single click.

Example: A developer can use this workflow to quickly create a new commit for a README.md file and push it to their Git repository, without having to manually execute each Git command.

## What You Can Do
- Triggered by a manual click, making it easy to use on-demand
- Automatically adds the README.md file to the Git repository
- Commits the changes with a pre-defined commit message
- Pushes the commit to the remote repository

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
