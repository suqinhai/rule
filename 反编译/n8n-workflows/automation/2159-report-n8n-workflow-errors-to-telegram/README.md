# 2159 Report N8N Workflow Errors To Telegram

This workflow sends a Telegram message when an error occurs in another workflow, providing a summary of the failed workflow and a link to the execution details.

Example: This workflow could be used to set up error handling for a critical business workflow, such as a customer order processing pipeline. Whenever an error occurs in the main workflow, this error handling workflow would automatically send a Telegram message to the relevant team members, allowing them to quickly investigate and resolve the issue.

## What You Can Do
- Triggers on workflow errors to provide immediate notification
- Customizable message content, including the name of the failed workflow and a link to the execution details
- Integrates with Telegram, a popular messaging platform, to deliver alerts directly to team members

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
