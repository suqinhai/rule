# 1473 Standup Bot 2 4 Read Config

This workflow allows users to read and convert a binary configuration file into a JSON format, enabling easy access and manipulation of the configuration data.

Example: A developer might use this workflow to load a configuration file containing settings for a web application, such as API keys, database connection details, or feature flags. By converting the binary file to JSON, the developer can easily access and update the configuration data programmatically.

## What You Can Do
- Reads a binary configuration file from a specified file path
- Converts the binary data to a JSON format for easy processing
- Provides a manual trigger to execute the workflow on demand

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
