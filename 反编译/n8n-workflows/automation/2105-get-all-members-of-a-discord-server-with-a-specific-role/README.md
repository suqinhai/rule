# 2105 Get All Members Of A Discord Server With A Specific Role

This workflow retrieves members from a Discord server, filters them based on a specific role, and saves their IDs to a Google Sheet, allowing for efficient tracking and management of server members.

Example: A community manager of a Discord server can use this workflow to automatically retrieve and store the IDs of members with a specific role, such as "Moderator" or "VIP". This can help the manager keep track of active members and easily identify those with special privileges or responsibilities.

## What You Can Do
- Retrieves members from a Discord server in batches of 100, handling pagination to ensure all members are processed
- Filters the retrieved members based on a specific role ID, ensuring only the desired members are processed
- Saves the member IDs to a Google Sheet, allowing for easy tracking and management of the server's member base
- Includes a setup node to easily configure the necessary credentials and settings for the workflow

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
