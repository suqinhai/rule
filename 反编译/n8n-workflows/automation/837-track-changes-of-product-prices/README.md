# 837 Track Changes Of Product Prices

This workflow monitors product prices on various websites, updates a local JSON file with the latest prices, and sends email notifications when a better price is found.

Example: A user could use this workflow to track the prices of sports equipment, such as soccer cleats, across multiple online retailers. The workflow would regularly check the prices, update a local file with the latest information, and send an email notification if a lower price is detected for a product the user is interested in.

## What You Can Do
- Automated price monitoring: The workflow uses a cron trigger to check product prices at regular intervals.
- Price comparison and updates: The workflow compares the current price to the previously saved price and updates the local file accordingly.
- Email notifications: The workflow sends email notifications when a better price is found, providing the user with the updated price and a link to the product.

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
