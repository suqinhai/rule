# 2074 Send N8N Automation Errors To A Monday Com Board

This workflow automatically creates a Monday.com board item to track and record errors that occur in a workflow, providing valuable insights for troubleshooting and process improvement.

Example: A software development team using n8n to automate various processes might encounter errors during workflow execution. This workflow would automatically create a Monday.com board item whenever an error occurs, capturing the workflow name, error message, stack trace, and the date/time of the error. This allows the team to quickly identify and address issues, improving the overall reliability and performance of their automated processes.

## What You Can Do
- Automatic error tracking and reporting on Monday.com
- Capture of detailed error information, including workflow name, error message, and stack trace
- Timestamp of when the error occurred for better context and analysis

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
