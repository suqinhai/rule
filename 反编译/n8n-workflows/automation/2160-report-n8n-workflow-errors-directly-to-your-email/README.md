# 2160 Report N8N Workflow Errors Directly To Your Email

This workflow sends an email notification when an error occurs in another workflow, providing details about the error and a link to the execution log.

Example: This workflow could be used as an error handling mechanism for other n8n workflows. When an error occurs in a workflow, this error handling workflow will be triggered, sending a detailed email notification to the specified email address. This allows the workflow owner to quickly identify and address any issues that arise.

## What You Can Do
- Triggers on workflow errors to send email notifications
- Includes details about the error, such as the error message and stack trace
- Provides a direct link to the execution log for easy troubleshooting

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
