# 2138 Create Linear Tickets From Notion Content

This workflow automatically creates Linear issues from Notion blocks, with the ability to customize the issue title, assignee, and description.

Example: A product manager uses this workflow to streamline the process of creating Linear issues from their team's Notion design review page. The workflow fetches the relevant Notion content, extracts the necessary information, and creates the corresponding Linear issues with the appropriate details.

## What You Can Do
- Automatically parses Notion block content to extract issue title, assignee, and description
- Shortens issue titles if they exceed a specified length
- Matches Notion assignee names to Linear user IDs
- Creates the Linear issue and adds a link back to the original Notion block
- Handles cases where the specified Linear team is not found

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?

* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
