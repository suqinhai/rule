# 1739 Move Data Between Json And Spreadsheets

This workflow retrieves random user data, converts it to a CSV file, and then sends the CSV file as an attachment in an email while also appending the data to a Google Sheets spreadsheet.

Example: A marketing team could use this workflow to gather random user data, create a CSV file, and share it with their sales team via email, while also storing the data in a Google Sheets spreadsheet for further analysis.

## What You Can Do
- Retrieves random user data from an API and converts it to a CSV file
- Sends the CSV file as an attachment in an email
- Appends the user data to a Google Sheets spreadsheet

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

⚠️ WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. 🚫

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
