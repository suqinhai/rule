# 1605 Extend N8N With Additional Tools

This workflow is a Telegram bot that allows users to request weather information for several European capitals, with the data displayed in an image generated using the R programming language.

Example: A user could interact with the bot by sending the "/getweather" command, which would trigger the workflow to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, process the data in R, and send the resulting image back to the user via Telegram.

## What You Can Do
- Handles different bot commands (e.g., "/start", "/getweather") using a switch node
- Fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and processes it in R to generate an image
- Provides error handling for both API and R script failures, with appropriate error messages sent to the user

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
