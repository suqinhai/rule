# 1073 Scrape And Store Data From Multiple Website Pages

This workflow scrapes SWIFT code data from a website, normalizes the country names, and stores the data in a MongoDB database.

Example: A financial institution or payment processing company might use this workflow to automatically gather and maintain a comprehensive database of SWIFT codes, which are essential for international wire transfers and other financial transactions.

## What You Can Do
- Extracts a list of countries from a website and iterates through them to scrape SWIFT code data
- Normalizes the country names using the uProc service to ensure consistent data
- Stores the scraped data (SWIFT codes, bank names, cities, etc.) in a MongoDB database
- Handles pagination and caching of HTML files to avoid redundant requests

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?

* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
