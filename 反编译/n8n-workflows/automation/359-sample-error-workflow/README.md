# 359 Sample Error Workflow

This workflow sends notifications to Mattermost and Twilio when an error occurs in a workflow, providing details about the error and the workflow that encountered it.

Example: A team using n8n to automate various business processes might use this workflow to quickly become aware of any errors that occur in their workflows, allowing them to investigate and resolve issues promptly. This can help ensure the reliability and smooth operation of their automated processes.

## What You Can Do
- Triggers on workflow errors, capturing details about the error and the workflow that encountered it
- Sends notifications to Mattermost, providing information about the error and the workflow
- Sends SMS notifications via Twilio, also including details about the error and the workflow

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
