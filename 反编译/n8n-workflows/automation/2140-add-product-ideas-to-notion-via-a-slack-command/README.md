# 2140 Add Product Ideas To Notion Via A Slack Command

This workflow allows Slack users to submit new ideas to a Notion database by using a Slack slash command, and provides a helpful message with instructions for adding more details to the idea.

Example: A team using this workflow can set up a Slack integration that allows their employees to submit new product or feature ideas by typing `/idea` in a Slack channel. The workflow then automatically creates a new page in a Notion database with the idea details, and sends a message back to the user with a link to add more information about the idea.

## What You Can Do
- Integrates Slack and Notion to streamline the idea submission process
- Provides a helpful message to the user with instructions for adding more details to the idea
- Easily extensible to support additional Slack commands (e.g., `/bug`, `/pain`) for different types of submissions

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?

* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
