# 2612 Ai Agent To Chat With Supabase Postgresql Db

This workflow enables users to interact with a Supabase/PostgreSQL database through an AI-powered conversational agent, allowing them to retrieve and analyze data without requiring SQL expertise.

Example: A business analyst can use this workflow to quickly get insights from their company's database. They can ask the AI agent questions like "What were the top-selling products last month?" or "Can you provide a summary of the customer data in the database?". The agent will dynamically generate SQL queries, execute them, and provide the relevant data and analysis in a conversational format.

## What You Can Do
- Conversational interface for database interaction, enabling users to query the data using natural language.
- Ability to retrieve and analyze data, including extracting and summarizing JSON data stored in the database.
- Automated SQL query generation and execution based on user requests, eliminating the need for manual SQL writing.
- Integration with Supabase/PostgreSQL databases, allowing users to access their data through the AI agent.

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
