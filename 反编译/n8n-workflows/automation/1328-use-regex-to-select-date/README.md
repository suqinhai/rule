# 1328 Use Regex To Select Date

This workflow allows users to set a "Close Date" field and automatically update it based on certain conditions.

Example: A sales team could use this workflow to set a default "Close Date" for new opportunities, and then automatically adjust the date if the opportunity is still open after a certain period of time.

## What You Can Do
- Allows manual triggering of the workflow
- Checks if a "Close Date" field is present and in the correct format
- Automatically sets the "Close Date" to 3 weeks in the future if the original date is not valid
- Provides an option to reset the "Close Date" to the original value

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
