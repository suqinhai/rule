# 996 Split In Batches Node Currentrunindex Example

This workflow generates a set of 10 items, splits them into batches of 1, and checks if the current batch index is equal to 5, at which point it sets a "Loop Ended" message.

Example: This workflow could be used to process a set of data in batches, with the ability to perform specific actions based on the current batch index. For example, it could be used to send email notifications or trigger other downstream processes when a certain batch is processed.

## What You Can Do
- Generates a set of 10 items using a Function node
- Splits the items into batches of 1 using the SplitInBatches node
- Checks the current batch index using an IF node and sets a "Loop Ended" message when the index is 5

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)
