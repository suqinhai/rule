# 1325 Transf Meeting Booking Into Notion S Task With Verified Information

This workflow automatically creates a new Notion database page for each new Calendly event, populating it with the event details and enriching the contact information using Dropcontact.

Example: A sales team uses this workflow to streamline their lead management process. Whenever a new prospect books a meeting through Calendly, the workflow automatically creates a new Notion database page with the prospect's contact information, including their LinkedIn profile, website, and other relevant details. This helps the sales team stay organized and have a centralized view of their pipeline.

## What You Can Do

- Enriches the contact information using Dropcontact, adding details like LinkedIn profile, website, and company information

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
