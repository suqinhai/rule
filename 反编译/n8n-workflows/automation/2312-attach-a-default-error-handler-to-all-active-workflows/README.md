# 2312 Attach A Default Error Handler To All Active Workflows

This workflow automatically updates the error handling configuration for active n8n workflows that do not have a custom error handler set.

Example: Imagine you have a team of developers working on various n8n workflows. Over time, some of these workflows may not have a custom error handler configured, leaving you vulnerable to unhandled errors. This workflow runs daily to identify these workflows and automatically update their error handling configuration to a predefined "default error handler" workflow, ensuring your team's workflows are properly monitored and errors are handled consistently.

## What You Can Do
- Automatically identifies active n8n workflows without a custom error handler set
- Updates the error handling configuration for these workflows to use a predefined "default error handler" workflow
- Sends an email notification when a workflow fails, providing the workflow name and a link to the failed execution
- Runs on a daily schedule to proactively maintain your n8n workflows' error handling setup

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
