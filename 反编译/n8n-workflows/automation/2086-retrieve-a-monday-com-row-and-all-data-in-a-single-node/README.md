# 2086 Retrieve A Monday Com Row And All Data In A Single Node

This workflow pulls data from a Monday.com board, including item details, linked pulses, and related subitem details, and aggregates the data into a comprehensive JSON output.

Example: A marketing team could use this workflow to pull data from a Monday.com board that tracks their marketing campaigns.

This could be used to generate reports, analyze campaign performance, or feed into other systems.

## What You Can Do

- Pulls linked pulses and their associated data, including sub-items and column details
- Aggregates all the retrieved data into a single, comprehensive JSON output

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
