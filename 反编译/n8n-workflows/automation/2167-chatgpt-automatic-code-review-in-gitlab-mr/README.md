# 2167 Chatgpt Automatic Code Review In Gitlab Mr

This workflow automates the process of reviewing code changes in a GitLab merge request and providing feedback directly in the GitLab discussion thread.

Example: A software development team can use this workflow to streamline their code review process. Whenever a new merge request is created, the workflow will automatically analyze the code changes, generate a review comment using a language model, and post it back to the GitLab discussion thread. This helps to ensure consistent and timely feedback on code changes, improving the overall code quality and collaboration within the team.

## What You Can Do
- Automatic analysis of code changes in a GitLab merge request
- Generation of a detailed code review comment using a language model
- Posting the review comment directly to the GitLab discussion thread
- Customizable prompts and filtering options to tailor the workflow to specific needs

## Quick Start

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
