# 1349 Create An Issue On Gitlab On Every Github Release

This workflow automatically checks for new releases in a GitHub repository, compares them to existing issues in a GitLab repository, and creates a new issue if a release is found without a corresponding issue.

Example: A software development team using this workflow can ensure that new releases of their software are properly tracked and documented in their issue tracking system. This helps maintain visibility and accountability around the release process.

## What You Can Do
- Automatically checks for new releases on a regular schedule (e.g., weekly)
- Compares new releases to existing issues to identify any missing documentation
- Automatically creates a new issue in the GitLab repository for any new release without a corresponding issue

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:

* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
