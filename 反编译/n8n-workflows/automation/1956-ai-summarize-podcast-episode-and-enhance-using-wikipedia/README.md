# 1956 Ai Summarize Podcast Episode And Enhance Using Wikipedia

This workflow takes a podcast transcript, summarizes it, extracts relevant topics and questions, researches and explains each topic using Wikipedia, and then sends a digest email with the summary, topics, and questions.

Example: A podcast host could use this workflow to automatically generate a summary and discussion guide for their listeners after recording a new episode. This would save the host time and provide their audience with a valuable recap and additional resources to explore the topics covered.

- Summarizes the podcast transcript using language models
- Extracts relevant topics and questions from the summary
- Researches and explains each topic in detail using Wikipedia
- Formats the summary, topics, and questions into an HTML email digest
- Sends the digest email to the podcast host or audience

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
