# 1132 Trigger A Build In Travis Ci When Code Changes Are Push To A Github Repo

This workflow automatically triggers a Travis CI build when a new pull request is opened or a push event occurs in the n8n repository.

Example: This workflow could be used by the n8n development team to automatically trigger a CI build whenever a new change is pushed or a pull request is opened in the n8n repository, ensuring that the codebase remains stable and any issues are caught early in the development process.

## What You Can Do
- Monitors the n8n repository on GitHub for push and pull request events
- Triggers a Travis CI build when a new pull request is opened or a push event occurs
- Includes a fallback "NoOp" node to handle any events that don't match the specified conditions

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
