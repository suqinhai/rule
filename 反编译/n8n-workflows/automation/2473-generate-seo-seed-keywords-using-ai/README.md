# 2473 Generate Seo Seed Keywords Using Ai

This workflow uses an AI-powered tool to generate a list of 15-20 seed keywords based on a user's ideal customer profile, providing a foundation for a comprehensive SEO strategy.

Example: A B2B SaaS company wants to improve its SEO performance and attract more of its ideal customers. They can use this workflow to input their ICP details, such as their product, customer pain points, goals, and expertise level. The workflow then generates a set of relevant seed keywords that the company can use to guide their content creation and optimization efforts.

## What You Can Do

- Considers various aspects of the customer journey, including awareness, consideration, and decision stages
- Provides a mix of product-related, problem-related, and solution-related keywords, as well as industry trends and related concepts

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
