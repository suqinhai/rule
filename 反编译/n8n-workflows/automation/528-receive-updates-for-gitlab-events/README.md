# 528 Receive Updates For Gitlab Events

This workflow automatically triggers a process when a change is made to a specific GitLab repository, enabling streamlined and efficient project management.

Example: A software development team could use this workflow to automatically trigger a build, test, or deployment process whenever a new commit is pushed to their GitLab repository, ensuring that changes are quickly and reliably integrated into their codebase.

## What You Can Do
- Triggers on any event (push, merge, issue, etc.) in the specified GitLab repository
- Allows for easy configuration of the repository and event types to monitor
- Integrates with GitLab API credentials for secure and authenticated access

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
