# 458 Run A Sql Query On Postgres

This workflow allows users to execute a SQL query on a Postgres database and retrieve the results with a single click.

Example: A business analyst could use this workflow to quickly pull data from a Postgres database and analyze it, without needing to write SQL queries or interact with the database directly.

## What You Can Do
- Manual trigger: The workflow is initiated by the user clicking a "execute" button, making it easy to use on-demand.
- Postgres integration: The workflow seamlessly connects to a Postgres database, allowing users to execute custom SQL queries.
- Query execution: The workflow can execute any SQL query and return the results, enabling users to retrieve the data they need.

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
