# 900 Add A Datapoint To Beeminder On Strava Activity Update

This workflow automatically logs Strava activities to a Beeminder goal, helping users stay accountable and motivated to achieve their fitness goals.

Example: A runner who wants to stay consistent with their training can use this workflow to automatically log their Strava runs to a Beeminder goal called "Running". This ensures that their progress is tracked, and they can stay motivated to keep up with their running routine.

## What You Can Do
- Triggers on new Strava activities, automatically logging them to a Beeminder goal
- Includes the activity name as a comment in the Beeminder entry, providing context
- Helps users stay accountable and motivated to achieve their fitness goals by integrating Strava and Beeminder

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
