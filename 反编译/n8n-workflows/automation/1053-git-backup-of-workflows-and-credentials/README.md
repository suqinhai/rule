# 1053 Git Backup Of Workflows And Credentials

This workflow automatically backs up your n8n workflows and credentials to a Git repository on a scheduled basis.

Example: A developer or DevOps engineer using n8n to automate various business processes might use this workflow to ensure their n8n configuration is regularly backed up and version-controlled, making it easy to restore or roll back changes if needed.

## What You Can Do
- Scheduled backup of n8n workflows and credentials to a Git repository
- Automatic Git commit and push operations to keep the repository up-to-date
- Option to manually trigger the backup process by clicking the "execute" button

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
