# 2398 Kb Tool Confluence Knowledge Base

This workflow integrates with a knowledge base tool (Confluence) to enhance the IT support process by enabling sophisticated search and response capabilities via Slack.

Example: An IT support agent receives a user query through a Slack message, which triggers this workflow. The workflow then refines the query using OpenAI's GPT-4, searches the knowledge base (Confluence) for relevant articles, and returns a response with the article title, link, and summary. This helps the IT support agent provide accurate and informative responses to the user, improving the overall efficiency and reliability of the IT support process.

## What You Can Do
- Receives user queries directly from a parent workflow
- Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4 to refine the query into searchable keywords
- Integrates with Confluence to search for relevant knowledge base articles
- Delivers a formatted response with the article title, link, and summary

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
