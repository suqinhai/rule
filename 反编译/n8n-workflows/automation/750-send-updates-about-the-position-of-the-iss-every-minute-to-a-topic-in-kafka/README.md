# 750 Send Updates About The Position Of The Iss Every Minute To A Topic In Kafka

This workflow periodically retrieves the current position of the International Space Station (ISS) and publishes the data to a Kafka topic.

Example: A space enthusiast or a company tracking satellite data could use this workflow to monitor the real-time location of the ISS and store the data in a Kafka cluster for further analysis or visualization.

## What You Can Do
- Scheduled data retrieval using a Cron trigger
- Fetching the latest ISS position from an external API
- Transforming the API response data into a structured format
- Publishing the ISS position data to a Kafka topic for downstream processing

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
