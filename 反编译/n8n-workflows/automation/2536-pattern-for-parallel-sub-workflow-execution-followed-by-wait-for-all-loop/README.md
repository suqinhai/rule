# 2536 Pattern For Parallel Sub Workflow Execution Followed By Wait For All Loop

This workflow orchestrates the asynchronous execution of multiple sub-workflows and waits for them to complete before continuing the main workflow.

Example: This workflow could be used to process multiple requests in parallel, such as sending notifications or updating records in a database, and then consolidate the results before taking further action.

## What You Can Do
- Starts multiple sub-workflows in parallel using a webhook
- Waits for all sub-workflows to complete before continuing the main workflow
- Tracks the completion status of each sub-workflow to ensure all have finished before proceeding

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
