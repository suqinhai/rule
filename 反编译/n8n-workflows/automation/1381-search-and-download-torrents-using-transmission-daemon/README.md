# 1381 Search And Download Torrents Using Transmission Daemon

This workflow automatically searches for and downloads torrent files based on a title received via a webhook, and sends notifications to a Telegram chat.

Example: A user could use this workflow to automatically download movies or TV shows they want to watch, by sending a request to the workflow's webhook with the title of the content they want to download. The workflow will then search for the torrent, start the download, and send a notification to the user's Telegram chat when the download is complete.

## What You Can Do
- Automatic torrent search and download based on a webhook trigger
- Error handling and retry logic to handle issues with the download process
- Telegram notifications to keep the user informed about the download status

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
