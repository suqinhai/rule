# 385 Send Airtable Data As Tasks To Trello

This workflow automates the process of creating a Trello card with a custom-designed banner for conference speakers who have a high total score in Airtable.

Example: A conference organizer could use this workflow to streamline the process of onboarding and promoting their speakers. When a speaker with a high total score in Airtable clicks the "execute" button, the workflow automatically retrieves their information from Airtable, generates a custom banner using Bannerbear, and creates a Trello card with the speaker's details and the banner image.

## What You Can Do
- Automatically filters Airtable records based on a "Total Score" criteria
- Generates a custom banner image using the speaker's information from Airtable
- Creates a Trello card with the speaker's details and the generated banner image

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
