# 1393 Extract And Store Text From Chat Images Using Aws S3

This workflow automates the process of extracting text from images uploaded via Telegram, storing the images in AWS S3, and appending the extracted text data to an Airtable database.

Example: A small business owner who receives product receipts from customers via Telegram can use this workflow to streamline their record-keeping process. Whenever a customer sends a receipt photo, the workflow will automatically upload the image to AWS S3, extract the text using AWS Textract, and append the data to an Airtable database for easy reference and analysis.

## What You Can Do
- Telegram-triggered workflow for easy customer interaction
- AWS Textract integration for accurate text extraction from images
- Airtable integration for structured data storage and management

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?

* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
