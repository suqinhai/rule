# 1222 Backup Workflows To Github

This workflow automatically backs up and updates your n8n workflows in a GitHub repository, providing a reliable and versioned backup system.

Example: A developer or IT administrator responsible for maintaining an n8n instance can use this workflow to ensure that all their n8n workflows are regularly backed up to a GitHub repository. This helps them keep track of changes, revert to previous versions if needed, and share workflows with their team.

## What You Can Do
- Scheduled daily backup of all n8n workflows to a GitHub repository
- Automatic creation and update of workflow files in the repository
- Versioning of workflow changes through Git commit messages

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
