# 1939 Send Labeled Email To A Notion Database

This workflow automatically creates Notion database pages for emails with a specific label, and removes the label when the task is completed in Notion.

Example: A user has a Gmail account and a Notion workspace. They want to create a workflow that automatically creates Notion pages for emails that are labeled "Notion". When the task is completed in Notion, the label is removed from the email. This allows the user to easily track and manage their email-related tasks in Notion.

## What You Can Do
- Automatically creates Notion database pages for emails with a specific label
- Removes the label from the email when the task is completed in Notion
- Checks if the email already exists in the Notion database before creating a new page

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
