# 2087 Streamline Data From An N8N Form Into Google Sheet Airtable And Email Sending

This workflow collects data from a form, processes it, and saves the formatted data to Google Sheets and Airtable while also sending customized emails to the submitter.

Example: A small business owner wants to collect customer information through a form on their website. This workflow would allow them to automatically save the form data to a Google Sheet and an Airtable base, while also sending a personalized email to the customer confirming their submission.

## What You Can Do
- Collects form data, including name, city, and email, and processes it to extract date and time information.
- Saves the formatted data to both Google Sheets and Airtable, making it accessible in multiple platforms.
- Sends customized email notifications to the form submitter, with the option to include dynamic content like the submitter's name and submission date.
- Provides a clear, documented workflow that can be easily maintained and updated as the business needs change.

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
