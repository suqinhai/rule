# 6 Sync Data Between Multiple Google Spreadsheets

This workflow automatically reads data from a Google Sheet, and then updates two other Google Sheets with the same data on a scheduled interval.

Example: A small business owner could use this workflow to regularly sync data from a master inventory sheet to separate sheets for different departments or locations, ensuring everyone has access to the latest information.

## What You Can Do
- Scheduled data synchronization using a Cron trigger
- Reads data from a specified range in a Google Sheet
- Writes the same data to two separate Google Sheets
- Configurable range and update operation for flexibility

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
