# 1804 Sync Your Github Issues To Your Notion Database

This workflow automatically manages GitHub issues by creating, updating, deleting, closing, and reopening Notion database pages based on the actions taken on the issues.

Example: A software development team uses this workflow to track and manage their GitHub issues in a Notion database. Whenever a new issue is opened in GitHub, a corresponding database page is created in Notion. If the issue is edited, deleted, closed, or reopened, the workflow updates the Notion database page accordingly.

## What You Can Do
- Automatically creates Notion database pages for new GitHub issues
- Updates Notion database pages when GitHub issues are edited, deleted, closed, or reopened
- Provides a centralized view of all GitHub issues in a Notion database

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
