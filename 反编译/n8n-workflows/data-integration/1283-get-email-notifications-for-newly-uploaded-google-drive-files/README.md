# 1283 Get Email Notifications For Newly Uploaded Google Drive Files

This workflow automatically sends an email notification whenever a new file is created in a specific Google Drive folder.

Example: A marketing team uses this workflow to stay informed about new content being added to their shared Google Drive folder. Whenever a team member uploads a new file, the workflow triggers and sends an email to the team, allowing them to quickly review and act on the new content.

## What You Can Do
- Monitors a specific Google Drive folder for new file creation
- Sends an email notification with details about the new file
- Configurable email settings, including recipient, subject, and message content

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
