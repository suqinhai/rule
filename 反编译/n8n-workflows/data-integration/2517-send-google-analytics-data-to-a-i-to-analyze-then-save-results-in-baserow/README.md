# 2517 Send Google Analytics Data To A I To Analyze Then Save Results In Baserow

This workflow analyzes Google Analytics data, compares it to the previous week, and sends the insights to an AI model to generate SEO recommendations, which are then saved to a Baserow database.

Example: A marketing manager wants to improve the SEO performance of their company's website. They set up this workflow to automatically fetch the latest Google Analytics data, including page engagement, search console metrics, and country-level views. The workflow then compares the current week's data to the previous week and sends the insights to an AI model, which provides tailored recommendations for improving SEO. The manager can then review the AI-generated report and implement the suggested changes to their website.

## What You Can Do
- Automatically fetches and compares Google Analytics data for the current and previous weeks
- Sends the data to an AI model to generate SEO recommendations
- Saves the AI-generated report to a Baserow database for easy access and tracking

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
