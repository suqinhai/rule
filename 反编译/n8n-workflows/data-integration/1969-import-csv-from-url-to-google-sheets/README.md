# 1969 Import Csv From Url To Google Sheets

This workflow automates the process of downloading a COVID-19 data CSV file, filtering the data to include only DACH (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) countries in 2023, and then uploading the filtered data to a Google Sheets spreadsheet.

Example: A data analyst or researcher working on COVID-19 trends could use this workflow to regularly update a spreadsheet with the latest data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) without having to manually download and process the CSV file.

## What You Can Do
- Automatically downloads the latest COVID-19 data CSV file from the ECDC website
- Filters the data to include only DACH countries in 2023
- Uploads the filtered data to a specified Google Sheets spreadsheet
- Includes a sticky note with a warning about Google API rate limits and a suggestion to add a "Split In Batches" and "Wait" node to handle larger datasets

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
