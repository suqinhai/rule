# 2 Transfer Data From Postgres To Excel

This workflow extracts product data from a PostgreSQL database, converts it into a spreadsheet file, and saves the file to the local file system.

Example: A business might use this workflow to regularly export product information from their database (such as product names and EAN codes) into a spreadsheet file, which can then be shared with sales teams or used for other reporting and analysis purposes.

## What You Can Do
- Retrieves data from a PostgreSQL database using a SQL query
- Converts the retrieved data into a spreadsheet file format (e.g., Excel)
- Saves the spreadsheet file to the local file system for further use or distribution

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
