# 1932 Send Alert When Data Is Created In App Database

This workflow automatically triggers a Slack notification whenever a new urgent bug is reported in the "Product & Design" team, allowing for quick response and resolution.

Example: A product manager or developer can use this workflow to stay informed about critical issues that arise in their project, ensuring they are addressed promptly and effectively. Whenever a new urgent bug is logged in the team's project management tool, the workflow will automatically send a notification to the designated Slack channel, allowing the team to take immediate action.

## What You Can Do
- Flexible trigger: The workflow can be triggered by various events, such as new issues in a project management tool, changes in a spreadsheet, or custom webhooks.
- Data transformation: The workflow filters the incoming data to only include urgent bugs and transforms the title to a more readable format.
- Customizable notification: The Slack notification can be customized to include relevant details, such as the issue title and a link to the issue, making it easy for the team to take action.

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
