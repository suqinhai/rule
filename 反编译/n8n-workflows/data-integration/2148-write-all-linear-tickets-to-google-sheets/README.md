# 2148 Write All Linear Tickets To Google Sheets

This workflow automatically retrieves all tickets from a specific team in a project management tool (Linear), applies custom fields, and writes the tickets to a Google Sheet.

Example: A project manager or team lead could use this workflow to keep track of all the tickets assigned to their team in a centralized Google Sheet. This could help them monitor progress, identify bottlenecks, and make data-driven decisions to improve team productivity.

## What You Can Do
- Retrieves all tickets from a specified team in Linear using GraphQL API
- Applies custom fields (e.g., estimate, labels) to each ticket
- Writes the tickets to a designated Google Sheet, allowing for easy analysis and reporting
- Handles pagination to retrieve all tickets, even if they exceed the initial API response limit
- Includes detailed setup instructions and notes to help users configure the workflow for their specific needs

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?

* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
