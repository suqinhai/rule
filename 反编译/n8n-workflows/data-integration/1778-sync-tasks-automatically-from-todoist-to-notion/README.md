# 1778 Sync Tasks Automatically From Todoist To Notion

This workflow automatically syncs Todoist tasks with a specific label to a Notion database, and then updates the Todoist task to indicate it has been sent to Notion.

Example: A user has a Todoist project for their work tasks, and they want to keep track of these tasks in a Notion database. They create a "send-to-notion" label in Todoist, and this workflow will automatically fetch those tasks, add them to the Notion database, and update the Todoist task to indicate it has been synced.

## What You Can Do
- Scheduled trigger to run the workflow at regular intervals
- Fetches Todoist tasks with a specific label
- Adds the tasks to a Notion database, including the Todoist task ID as a property
- Updates the Todoist task to indicate it has been sent to Notion, and includes a link to the Notion page

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
