# 2141 Add Product Ideas To Google Sheets Via A Slack

This workflow allows Slack users to submit new ideas, which are then automatically added to a Google Sheets document, and a follow-up message is sent to the user requesting more details.

Example: A team using this workflow can enable their Slack users to submit new product ideas by typing the `/idea` command in Slack. The workflow will capture the idea and the user's name, add it to a Google Sheets document, and send a message back to the user asking them to provide more details about the idea.

## What You Can Do
- Captures new ideas submitted via a Slack slash command and stores them in a Google Sheets document
- Sends a follow-up message to the user who submitted the idea, requesting more details
- Easily extensible to support additional Slack commands (e.g., `/bug`, `/pain`) to capture different types of feedback

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)
