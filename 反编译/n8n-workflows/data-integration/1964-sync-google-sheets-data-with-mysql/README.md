# 1964 Sync Google Sheets Data With Mysql

This workflow automatically synchronizes data between a Google Sheet and a MySQL database, updating the Google Sheet's "DB Status" column and triggering notifications for outdated records.

Example: A company that collects event inquiries through a Google Form can use this workflow to streamline their data management process. The workflow automatically retrieves new inquiries from the Google Sheet, compares them with the MySQL database, and updates the Google Sheet's "DB Status" column accordingly. It also sends notifications for any inquiries that have not been updated in the database for more than 4 hours, allowing the team to quickly address any outstanding tasks.

## What You Can Do
- Automated data synchronization between Google Sheets and MySQL
- Conditional logic to update the Google Sheet's "DB Status" column based on database status
- Notification system to alert the team about outdated records

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
