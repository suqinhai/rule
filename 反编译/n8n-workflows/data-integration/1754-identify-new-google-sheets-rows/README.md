# 1754 Identify New Google Sheets Rows

This workflow automatically processes new rows in a Google Sheet, marking them as processed and performing additional actions as needed.

Example: A business might use this workflow to monitor a Google Sheet containing customer orders or sales leads. Whenever a new row is added to the sheet, the workflow will detect it, mark the row as processed, and perform any necessary follow-up actions, such as sending a notification or updating a CRM system.

## What You Can Do
- Automatically detects and processes new rows in a Google Sheet
- Marks rows as processed to avoid duplicate processing
- Allows for additional actions to be performed on new rows, such as sending notifications or updating other systems

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
