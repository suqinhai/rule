# 1948 Xml To Sql Database Import

This workflow extracts product data from an XML file, transforms it into a JSON format, and then inserts the data into a MySQL database.

Example: A company that sells various products may use this workflow to automate the process of importing new product information into their database. By providing an XML file with the necessary product details, the workflow can handle the extraction, transformation, and insertion of the data into a MySQL database, streamlining the data management process.

## What You Can Do
- Reads binary data from a specified XML file
- Converts the XML data into a JSON format using the XML node
- Splits the JSON data into individual product items using the Item Lists node
- Inserts the product data into a MySQL database table using the MySQL node
- Includes a sticky note with a SQL query to create and truncate the target table, which can be executed as needed

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
