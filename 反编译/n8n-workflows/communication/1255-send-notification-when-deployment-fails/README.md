# 1255 Send Notification When Deployment Fails

This workflow automatically sends a notification to a Slack channel when a website deployment fails on Netlify.

Example: A web development team uses this workflow to stay informed about any issues with their website deployments. Whenever a deployment fails on Netlify, the team receives a detailed Slack message with the error message and a link to the failed deployment, allowing them to quickly investigate and resolve the problem.

## What You Can Do
- Triggers on Netlify's "deployFailed" event, automatically detecting when a deployment fails
- Sends a customized Slack message with the site name, error message, and a link to the failed deployment
- Allows the team to stay informed about deployment issues in real-time, improving their ability to respond and resolve problems quickly

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

⚠️ WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. 🚫

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
