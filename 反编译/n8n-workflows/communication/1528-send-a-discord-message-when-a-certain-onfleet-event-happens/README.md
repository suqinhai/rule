# 1528 Send A Discord Message When A Certain Onfleet Event Happens

This workflow automatically sends a notification to a Discord channel whenever a task is started in Onfleet, a delivery management platform.

Example: A logistics company using Onfleet to manage their delivery operations can set up this workflow to keep their team informed in real-time about the status of deliveries. Whenever a driver starts a new delivery task in Onfleet, the workflow will instantly send a message to a designated Discord channel, allowing the team to stay up-to-date and coordinate their efforts.

## What You Can Do
- Triggers on task start events in Onfleet
- Sends notifications to a specified Discord channel
- Provides real-time visibility into delivery operations

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
