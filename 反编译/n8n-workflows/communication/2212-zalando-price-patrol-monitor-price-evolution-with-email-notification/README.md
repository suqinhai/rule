# 2212 Zalando Price Patrol Monitor Price Evolution With Email Notification

This workflow automatically monitors Zalando product prices, updates a Google Sheet with the latest prices, and sends an email notification when a product's price drops below a user-specified alert price.

Example: A small business owner wants to keep track of the prices of certain products on the Zalando e-commerce platform. They can use this workflow to set up price alerts, so they are notified when the price of a product they are interested in drops below their desired threshold. This allows them to quickly take advantage of price reductions and make informed purchasing decisions for their business.

## What You Can Do
- Allows users to add new products to monitor by providing a Zalando product URL and a price alert threshold
- Automatically scrapes the current price of each monitored product and updates a Google Sheet with the latest information
- Sends an email notification when a product's price drops below the user-specified alert price

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
