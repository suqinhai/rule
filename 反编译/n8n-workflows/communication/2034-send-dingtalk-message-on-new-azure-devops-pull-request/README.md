# 2034 Send Dingtalk Message On New Azure Devops Pull Request

This workflow automates the process of sending a DingTalk message to the appropriate team members whenever a new pull request is created in Azure DevOps, ensuring timely notification and collaboration.

Example: A software development team using Azure DevOps for their project management and source control needs to ensure that the relevant team members are notified whenever a new pull request is created. This workflow can be set up to automatically send a DingTalk message to the appropriate team members, including the pull request details and a list of reviewers, based on the mapping between Azure DevOps user accounts and their corresponding DingTalk contact information.

## What You Can Do
- Integrates with Azure DevOps to capture new pull request creation events
- Leverages a MySQL database to map Azure DevOps user accounts to their DingTalk contact information
- Customizes the DingTalk message content, including the ability to mention specific team members or the entire team
- Sends the DingTalk message using the DingTalk group chat robot webhook

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
