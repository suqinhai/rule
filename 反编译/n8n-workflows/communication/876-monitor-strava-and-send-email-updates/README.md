# 876 Monitor Strava And Send Email Updates

This workflow automatically checks a user's Strava activity data daily and sends an email to their accountability partners if the user's activity level falls below a specified threshold.

Example: A fitness enthusiast wants to stay accountable to their workout routine. They set up this workflow to monitor their Strava activity and notify their accountability partners (e.g., friends, family, or a fitness group) if they haven't been active enough.

## What You Can Do
- Automatically checks Strava activity data daily at 11 AM
- Compares the user's activity time to a pre-set threshold
- Sends an email to the user's accountability partners if the activity time is below the threshold
- Allows the user to customize the activity threshold, their own name and email, and the email addresses of their accountability partners

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
