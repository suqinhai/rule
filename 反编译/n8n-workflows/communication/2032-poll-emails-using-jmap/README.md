# 2032 Poll Emails Using Jmap

This workflow fetches the user's Fastmail account and mailbox details, then retrieves the 3 most recent unread emails from the user's inbox.

Example: A user could use this workflow to quickly check their Fastmail inbox for any new unread messages without having to log in to the Fastmail web interface. The workflow could be triggered manually or scheduled to run periodically to keep the user informed of their inbox status.

## What You Can Do

- Retrieves the 3 most recent unread emails from the user's inbox
- Displays the email details (sender, subject, received date) in the workflow output

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
