# 13 Transform Xml Data And Upload To Dropbox

This workflow retrieves an XML file, converts it to JSON, modifies the title, converts it back to XML, and saves the updated file to Dropbox.

Example: A marketing team might use this workflow to automatically update the title of a product catalog XML file, convert it to the desired format, and save it to their Dropbox storage for easy access and sharing with their sales team.

## What You Can Do
- Retrieves XML data from a web endpoint
- Converts XML data to JSON format for easy manipulation
- Allows modification of the XML data (in this case, changing the title)
- Converts the modified JSON data back to XML format
- Saves the updated XML file to Dropbox for storage and sharing

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?

* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
