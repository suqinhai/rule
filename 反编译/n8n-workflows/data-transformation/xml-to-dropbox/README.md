# Xml To Dropbox

This workflow retrieves an XML file, converts it to JSON, modifies the title, converts it back to XML, and saves the updated XML file to Dropbox.

Example: A user might use this workflow to automatically fetch an XML file from a public API, update the title of the content, and then save the modified XML file to their Dropbox account for further processing or sharing.

## What You Can Do
- Fetches XML data from a public API
- Converts the XML data to JSON format for easy manipulation
- Allows the user to update the title of the XML content
- Converts the modified JSON data back to XML format
- Saves the updated XML file to the user's Dropbox account

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. üö´

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
